Mock Interview for Software Developer Role
Hereâ€™s the plan: Iâ€™ll ask you a mix of moderate to difficult questions, rated on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is the most challenging. Let me know your answer to each, and Iâ€™ll provide feedback.

Topic: C Programming
Question 1 (Difficulty: 3/5)
In C, what is the difference between malloc() and calloc()? Can you write a simple program to demonstrate their usage?

Take your time to answer!

Answer to Question 1
Difference Between malloc() and calloc():
Feature	malloc()	calloc()
Initialization	Does not initialize the allocated memory. The memory contains garbage values.	Initializes all allocated memory to zero.
Syntax	void* malloc(size_t size);	void* calloc(size_t num, size_t size);
Parameters	Takes a single parameter: the total number of bytes to allocate.	Takes two parameters: the number of elements and the size of each element.
Performance	Slightly faster as it skips initialization.	Slower due to memory initialization.
Example Code:
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    // Using malloc
    int *arr1 = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // Allocating memory for 5 integers
    if (arr1 == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Using malloc:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("arr1[%d] = %d\n", i, arr1[i]); // Prints garbage values
    }

    // Using calloc
    int *arr2 = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int)); // Allocating memory for 5 integers and initializing to 0
    if (arr2 == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("\nUsing calloc:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("arr2[%d] = %d\n", i, arr2[i]); // Prints 0 for all elements
    }

    // Free allocated memory
    free(arr1);
    free(arr2);

    return 0;
}
Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further! Ready for the next question?

Topic: React
Question 4 (Difficulty: 5/5)
In React, how does the Context API work, and how does it differ from passing props?

Write a React application that demonstrates:

A Context Provider to share a theme (light or dark) across multiple components.
A Child Component that consumes this theme and applies a background color accordingly.
A button in the parent component to toggle between themes.
