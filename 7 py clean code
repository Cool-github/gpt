Here is a Python code to calculate the factorial of a number:

python
Copy code
# Function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage
number = 5
result = factorial(number)

print(f"The factorial of {number} is: {result}")
Explanation:
Factorial Function: The factorial function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number n. The base case is when n is 0 or 1, returning 1. Otherwise, it multiplies n by the factorial of n-1.
Example Usage: The number 5 is passed to the function, and the result is printed.

Here's a more concise version of the factorial code in Python:

python
Copy code
# Function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n == 0 or n == 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage
print(f"The factorial of 5 is: {factorial(5)}")
Explanation:
The function is simplified using a ternary operator (1 if n == 0 or n == 1 else ...), which directly returns the factorial value without needing extra lines.
The print statement calculates and displays the result for 5.
